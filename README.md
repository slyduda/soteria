# Soteria - Finite State Machine

`Soteria` is a lightweight, object-oriented finite state machine implementation in Javascript. `Soteria` has zero-dependencies and is useful for both frontend and backend applications.

## Installation

```
npm install @olympos/soteria
```

## Quickstart

Here is a simple example of how to leverage `Soteria`:

```ts
const matterMachine = addStateMachine(
  {
    state: "solid",
  },
  {
    melt: { origins: "solid", destination: "liquid" },
    evaporate: { origins: "liquid", destination: "gas" },
  }
);
console.log(matterMachine.state); // solid
matterMachine.trigger("melt"); // Trigger the melt transition
console.log(matterMachine.state); // liquid
```

Here is a class based approach with better type safety:

```ts
type MatterState = "solid" | "liquid" | "gas" | "plasma";
type MatterTrigger =
  | "melt"
  | "evaporate"
  | "sublimate"
  | "ionize"
  | "freeze"
  | "depose"
  | "condense"
  | "recombine";

class Matter {
  state: MatterState;

  constructor(state: MatterState) {
    this.state = state;
  }
}

const matterMachineDict: TransitionDict<MatterState, MatterTrigger, Matter> = {
  melt: { origins: "solid", destination: "liquid" },
  evaporate: { origins: "liquid", destination: "gas" },
  sublimate: { origins: "solid", destination: "gas" },
  ionize: { origins: "gas", destination: "plasma" },
};

// Initialize a Matter object and attach a state machine to it
const matter = addStateMachine(new Matter("solid"), matterMachineDict);
console.log(matter.state); // solid
matter.trigger("melt"); // Trigger the melt transition
console.log(matter.state); // liquid
```

## Concepts

A state machine is a model of behavior composed of a finite number of states and transitions between those states. Within each state and transition some action can be performed. A state machine needs to start at some initial state. Below, we will look at some core concepts and how to work with them.

- `State`: A condition or stage in a state machine. A `State` can describe a phase in a process or a mode of behavior.

- `Transition`: A process or event that causes the state machine to change from one state to another.

- `Model`: An entity that gets updated during transitions. It may also define actions that will be executed during transitions. This is also described as context.

- `Machine`: An entity that manages and controls the model, states, transitions, and actions.

- `Trigger`: An event that initiates a transition, the method that sends the signal to start a transition.

- `Action`: An operation or task that is performed when a certain state is entered, exited, or during a transition.

### Basics

In order to create an object with a state machine, it must be `Stateful`, or having a `.state` property that the machine can reference. Some examples of this are:

```js
// Simple object untyped approach
const matter = {
  state: "solid",
};
```

```ts
// Class based typed approach
type MatterState = "solid" | "liquid" | "gas" | "plasma";
class Matter {
  state: MatterState;

  constructor(state: MatterState) {
    this.state = state;
  }
}
const matter = new Matter("solid");
```

You can create a very simple working state machine bound to `matter` like this:

```ts
import {} from "@olympos/soteria";

const matterMachine = addStateMachine(matter, ["solid", "liquid"]);
```

You can now transition your state machine to any destination listed in the list above:

```ts
matterMachine.to("liquid");
console.log(matterMachine.state); // liquid
```

Calling `addStateMachine` on `matter` creates `matterMachine` which includes all of the base object's properties and methods while also attaching various state machine methods.

## Transitions

### .to(state: StateType)

The `.to()` method is helpful for simple state transitions as demonstrated in the last example. Simply supply a state and if it exists transition to it without any checks or side effects.

```ts
const matter = addStateMachine(
  {
    state: "solid",
  }, // The object
  ["solid", "liquid"] // The available states
);

console.log(matter.state); // solid
matter.to("liquid");
console.log(matter.state); // liquid
```

### .trigger(trigger: TriggerType, options?: TransitionOptions)

In most use cases where finite state machines are needed, it is often helpful to have additional logic that happens before, during, and after transitions. This is where the `.trigger()` method is helpful.

```ts
import { TransitionDict } from "@olympos/soteria";

type HeroState = "idle" | "sleeping";
type HeroTrigger = "patrol" | "sleep";

class Hero {
  state: HeroState;
  energy: number;

  constructor(state: HeroState) {
    this.state = state;
    this.energy = 1;
  }

  work() {
    console.log("The hero is expending energy!");
    this.energy--;
  }

  hasEnergy() {
    return this.energy > 0;
  }
}

const transitionDict: TransitionDict<HeroState, HeroTrigger, Hero> = {
  patrol: {
    origins: "idle",
    destination: "idle",
    conditions: "hasEnergy",
    effects: "work",
  },
  sleep: {
    origins: "idle",
    destination: "sleeping",
  },
};

const hero = addStateMachine(new Hero("idle"), transitionDict);
hero.trigger("patrol");
// The hero is expending energy!
hero.trigger("patrol"); // No log because condition is not met so the hero does not work
```

### Passing Data

Data can be passed from the initial trigger function into all methods being called during the transition:

```ts
export class Matter {
  state: MatterState;
  temperature: number;
  pressure: number;

  constructor(state: MatterState, temperature?: number, pressure?: number) {
    this.state = state;
    this.temperature = temperature ?? 0;
    this.pressure = pressure ?? 101.325;
  }

  setEnvironment(props?: { temperature: number; pressure: number }) {
    const { temperature = 0, pressure = 101.325 } = props ?? {};
    this.temperature = temperature;
    this.pressure = pressure;
  }
}

export const matterMachineDict: TransitionDict<
  MatterState,
  MatterTrigger,
  Matter
> = {
  melt: [
    { origins: "solid", destination: "liquid", effects: "setEnvironment" },
  ],
  evaporate: [{ origins: "liquid", destination: "gas" }],
  sublimate: [{ origins: "solid", destination: "gas" }],
  ionize: [{ origins: "gas", destination: "plasma" }],
};
```

If we pass any props into the second argument of the trigger function, they will be passed to all conditions and all effects:

```ts
matterMachine.trigger("melt", { temperature: 20 });
```

One caveat is that we don't get type inference on the props, but you may cast them.

### Configuration

The initial state machine may be configured with any of the following options like so:

```ts
const matter = addStateMachine(new Matter(), matterTransitionDict, {
  verbosity: false,
  throwExceptions: false,
  strictOrigins: false,
});
```

Further configuration in individual transitions may be changed and take priority:

```ts
matter.triggerWithOptions("evaporate", {
  throwExceptions: true,
});
```

More configuration options will come as `Soteria` grows

## Advanced

Debugging State Transitions is notoriously difficult. It is for this reason that each transition returns a structured object of the history of the context throughout the transition.

```ts
export class ExampleObject {
  state: ExampleObjectState;
  speed: number;
  energy: number;

  constructor(energy?: number) {
    this.state = "stopped";
    this.energy = energy ?? 1;
    this.speed = 0;
  }

  speedUp() {
    this.speed = 1;
    this.energy--;
  }

  slowDown() {
    this.speed = 0;
  }

  hasEnergy(): boolean {
    return this.energy > 0;
  }
}

export const exampleMachineDict: TransitionDict<
  ExampleObjectState,
  ExampleObjectTrigger,
  ExampleObject
> = {
  walk: {
    origins: ["stopped"],
    destination: "walking",
    effects: ["speedUp"],
    conditions: ["hasEnergy"],
  },
  stop: {
    origins: ["walking"],
    destination: "stopped",
  },
};

const myObject = new ExampleObject(1);
const objectMachine = addStateMachine(myObject, exampleMachineDict);
objectMachine.trigger("walk");
objectMachine.trigger("stop");
const response = objectMachine.trigger("walk"); // Will fail

console.log(response);

// {
//   success: false,
//   failure: {
//     type: "ConditionValue",
//     undefined: false,
//     trigger: "walk",
//     method: "hasEnergy",
//     context: { state: "stopped", speed: 1, energy: 0 },
//   },
//   initial: "stopped",
//   current: "stopped",
//   attempts: [
//     {
//       name: "walk",
//       success: false,
//       failure: {
//         type: "ConditionValue",
//         undefined: false,
//         trigger: "walk",
//         method: "hasEnergy",
//         context: { state: "stopped", speed: 1, energy: 0 },
//       },
//       conditions: [
//         {
//           name: "hasEnergy",
//           success: false,
//           context: { state: "stopped", speed: 1, energy: 0 },
//         },
//       ],
//       effects: [],
//       transition: {
//         origins: ["stopped"],
//         destination: "walking",
//         effects: ["speedUp"],
//         conditions: ["hasEnergy"],
//       },
//       context: { state: "stopped", speed: 1, energy: 0 },
//     },
//   ],
//   precontext: { state: "stopped", speed: 1, energy: 0 },
//   context: { state: "stopped", speed: 1, energy: 0 },
// };
```

Destructured for simpler design:

```ts
const { success, failure } = objectMachine.trigger("walk");
```
